### 6. ðŸ’¯ use react-error-boundary

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/06.extra-6.js)

As cool as our own `ErrorBoundary` is, I'd rather not have to maintain it in the
long-term. Luckily for us, there's an npm package we can use instead and it's
already installed into this project. It's called
[`react-error-boundary`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary).

Go ahead and give that a look and swap out our own `ErrorBoundary` for the one
from `react-error-boundary`.
